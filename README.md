# Logitech K375s Mechenical Keyboard Mod
This project was developed to mod the Logitech K375s and use the controller on a mechanical keyboard.

In order to to that I first reverse engineered the K375s membrane and created the keys matrix. Then with that matrix I created 3 keyboard types:
 - Full - 105 keys
 - TKL
 - 84 Keys

I did not created the PCB yet, but I already wiered the switches and it works perfectly.
#

To create the layouts I used [keyboard layout editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com)

To create the plates I used [swillkb plate and case builder
](http://builder.swillkb.com)

To create the schematic and PCB I used [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com)

This was my first PCB design so if you find any problem, if you have any suggestion or if you have any doubt please let me know.

Also feel free to use this to create you own PCB :)

And [this guide](https://post.smzdm.com/p/a99v2k80/) was also verry helpfull to create the PCB
